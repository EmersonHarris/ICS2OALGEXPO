##### I have set up this file and I have been unsuccsessfull at learning how to use the pyraminx so far and don't understand it's algorithms

## 02/19/2020

##### I have not made any progress in learning the algorithms of the pyraminx, though I have watched some tutorials it may be because I haven't had the sound on

## 02/20/2020

##### I still am un able to solve the pyraminx I am considering using the pyraminx duo

## 02/24/2020

##### Today was a fairly unpreductive day, I have still not learned how to solve the pyraminx's algorithms

## 02/25/2020

##### I have started to time my self with the pyraminx duo and I am still try to learn the pyraminx's algorithms
#### Pyraminx Duo Times:
* ao5: 7.49sec
* ao12: 7.43sec
* ao25: 8.66sec

## 02/26/2020

##### I have been watching algorithm videos all class and I am still unable to solve it
